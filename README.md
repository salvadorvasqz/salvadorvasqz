### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with experience delivering production-ready web applications using React.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating intuitive, performant, and scalable user interfaces that solve real-world problems.

Beyond coding, I have a strong background in education, having taught programming, game development (C#, Unity, Roblox), robotics (Arduino, LEGO), and mathematics. Teaching has sharpened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly—an essential skill in collaborative software teams.

Currently, I'm seeking new challenges as a Frontend Developer where I can grow, contribute, and continue building impactful digital experiences.
